Description
The purpose of this project was to create a coding quiz that had a time limit and a leaderboard at the end.

When the user first visits the site they get some instructions. They are then prompted to click on a "start" button. Once they do that the timer starts (75 seconds). They have several multiple choice questions to get through. After completing the quiz they receive a score. They are then able to type in their name so that their score is added to a leaderboard.
